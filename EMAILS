Found in #docker. He does bioinformatics for cancer research,
doesn't use docker but is interested in it and wants an invite.
He likes that we will vet quality and wants better search (facets)
and social around docker images.
He's researching stuff like this https://github.com/mesosphere/deimos
Currently runs OpenStack but doesn't like performance hit of VMs.
Ask me for full chat logs if desired.
