Monitoring: Found something that seems to be much better
  http://sensuapp.org/docs/0.12/guide
  Following this guide...

* install statsd on prod w/ supervisor
  - add statsd agent to hosts (collectd)
  - use https://github.com/collectd/collectd to ship host-level data to statsd
    - https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:StatsD
    - cpu memory disk network
  - use this as a guide for how to name stuff coming in from statsd agents http://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2013/06/26/practical-guide-to-graphite-monitoring/
  - use console backend
  - feed data to http://influxdb.org/
    - http://influxdb.org/docs/api/http.html
    - https://github.com/FGRibreau/influxdb-cli
    - github.com/damm/docker-influxdb

* Display metrics and allow upgrades which will assist in scaling
  - containers/show - disk usage & disk upper limit (upgradable -- may require user-scheduleable downtime thru a form with a date picker)
  - hosts/index - disk usage vs max
  - hosts/show - disk, cpu, ram, processes on host

* Public Status Page
  - need to expose a host attribute: online?
  - need stats system to modify this attribute based on health findings
  - need view to use this attribute and not actually do its own health check on render

* Autoscaler
  - we just CAN'T resize disks without downtime
  - we CAN check container size and display it to user
  - we CAN offer price tiers based on storage upper limit
  - we CAN allow upgrading storage upper limit
    - requires user-acknowledged downtime
    - does not impact other users because it happens by means of an export/import onto another virtual server that has the given free space
  - we CAN email users when a container is close to reaching upper limit
  - the above strategies should solve disk-related scaling problems. this should force us to spread the load enough to the point where ram and cpu limits are less likely to be hit by the containers, but we'll have to monitor this in production to determine if we must devise a strategy for those as well.
  - also consider looking at https://coreos.com but this isn't supported on DO, but it is on rackspace: https://coreos.com/docs/running-coreos/cloud-providers/rackspace/
  - we CAN set runtime constraints: http://docs.docker.io/reference/run/#runtime-constraints-on-cpu-and-memory

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_cluster

* Polish
  - email signup form
    - Name, Email, What should we have ready by the time you get your invite for you to be happy (certain image(s), feature X) ? Thanks!
  - splash page design by a professional

* Launch
  - post to reddit, hackernews, etc

## Post Launch features

* Multi-image templates
  - look at fig.yml http://orchardup.github.io/fig/yml.html

* Container file editing

* Private Images (see below use cases)

* Mobile Strategy
  * Ability to upload a Dockerfile as a private image (let's find out what's best for customers)

  * expose an API to spin up and spin down hyperdock containers

  * An iOS library that implements the Hyperdock API
    - the idea behind this is to allow mobile developers to easily outsource backend complexity for their customers to us
    - e.g. iOS app offers in-app purchase for a hosted service, that uses hyperdock's api, etc.

* Ability to commit a container (thus producing an Image, this is a docker feature) which is then tied to your user so as to become available in your Images list as a private image.
  - In essence this is a "Snapshot" and can be classified and labelled as such.
