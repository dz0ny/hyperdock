setting up vagrant to model a sane production multi-machine deploy
need to add dotenv
need to use packer to build boot2docker images with sensu builtin for use on public cloud

---
influxdb is looking good (installed as a docker image in dev, working) waiting on sensu to continue with this
sensu is looking good (research results are positive, have yet to install) check links in TODO to pick up on this
we want to get sensu and influxdb working well, use this https://github.com/lusis/sensu_influxdb_handler
we cannot use highcharts due to licensing issues, so we will be using https://github.com/masayuki0812/c3 instead
check out shinken too : http://www.shinken-monitoring.org/
